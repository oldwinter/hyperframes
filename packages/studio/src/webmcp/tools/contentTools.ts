/**
 * `studio_set_text` and `studio_set_style`: the first tools that change the file.
 *
 * Both operate on the CURRENT selection and take no handle. That is not an
 * omission. `handleDomTextCommit(value, fieldKey?)` and
 * `handleDomStyleCommit(property, value)` read the ambient React selection, and
 * `applyDomSelection` only schedules a state update, so selecting and
 * committing inside one call would write to whatever was selected before.
 * Two tool calls are separated by a render. Select first, then edit.
 *
 * Every write here is guarded before dispatch and verified after. Studio has
 * several paths where a failed commit resolves anyway, so "the function did not
 * throw" proves nothing; the outcome the handler now returns is what proves it.
